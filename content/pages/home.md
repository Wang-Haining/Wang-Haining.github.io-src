Hi, I'm a doctoral student in the Department of Information & Library Science at Indiana University Bloomington.
Currently I'm under the supervision of [Dr. Allen Riddell](https://www.ariddell.org/) (chair), [Dr. Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/), and [Dr. StaÅ¡a MilojeviÄ‡](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~smilojev/) (minor, data science).
I received an M.A. degree in Archival Studies from Wuhan University (supervised by [Dr. Xincai Wang](https://sim.whu.edu.cn/info/1051/1540.htm)) and a B.S. & a B.A. from Shanxi University.

My research interrogates problems in the social sciences and humanities from a computational perspective.
Currently I'm focusing on authorship identification and adversarial stylometry.
Our ongoing projects cover recovering the authorship of Chinese vernacular fiction written during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (over three-quarters of them were composed pseudonymously or anonymously!) and building adversarially resistant authorship identification tools capable of corrupting style deception (attacks). 

Before IUB, my interests lay in the topics of collection development in academic libraries and digital curation.
