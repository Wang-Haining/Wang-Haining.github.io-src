Hi, it's Haining (he/him/his), a fourth-year doctoral student from the Department of Information & Library Science at Indiana University Bloomington.
I'm under the supervision of [Dr. Allen Riddell](https://www.ariddell.org/) (chair), [Dr. Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/), and [Dr. StaÅ¡a MilojeviÄ‡](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~smilojev/) (minor, Data Science).
I received an M.A. degree in Archival Studies from Wuhan University (supervised by [Dr. Xincai Wang](https://sim.whu.edu.cn/info/1049/11658.htm)) and a B.S. & a B.A. from Shanxi University.

I create responsible AI to help people better preserve their anonymity and privacy when communicating in natural language. My other ongoing projects include recovering authorship of pseudonymously/anonymously composed Ming-Qing vernacular fiction and understanding *creative language use* for self-censorship in Chinese.

### News

- (Nov 19, 2022) We launched our AI (`sas_baseline`) [online](https://huggingface.co/haining/sas_baseline). The AI is built to "translate" hard-to-understand, expert-oriented scientific abstracts into accessible, relevant narratives. We hope it allows the lay audience to fully enjoy the benefits of open science and pave the last mile toward scientific understanding. As a LEADING midterm output, we will be improving the baseline model.
