Greetings üëã I'm an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Indiana Univeristy School of Medicine.
My research focuses on understanding the cultural and sociotechnical dynamics reflected in language and real-world data, and using this knowledge to develop AI applications that enhance societal well-being.
My work is grounded in natural language processing, biomedical informatics, and computational humanities/social sciences.


My representative work includes:

- üíä Phenotyping with [effective, robust, and secure use of medication records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Y8gy-lIWCWFLPSgMY0186Z2rNDb4-lLJhVsc3FnyXU/edit?usp=sharing) through simple chat with LLMs,  
- üßë‚Äçüî¨ Making [scientific narratives accessible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17088) at a high-school reading level for individuals with lower literacy, 
- üé≠ Developing [strong and usable countermeasures](https://hdl.handle.net/2022/33626) against content fingerprinting attacks for whistleblowers, 
- üë¨ Attributing early works in [disputes between Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae084) through statistical evidence, and
- üß¨ Developing [a principled measure of scientific novelty](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57867-0_31) that aligns with human judgment.

### What's New


- (Jul 8, 2025) Our new preprint [*Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04224) is out! TL;DR: Current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.


- (May 20, 2025) I presented *Thinking, Fast and Slow: Knowledge Extraction to Facilitate Phenotyping Using Drug Records* in Real-World Data at the Midwest Biopharmaceutical Statistics Workshop 2025. Check out our [DualReasoning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Y8gy-lIWCWFLPSgMY0186Z2rNDb4-lLJhVsc3FnyXU/edit?usp=sharing), which enables effective, robust, and secure use of medication records through simple chat with LLMs.


- (May 9, 2025) I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, *Defending Against Authorship Attribution Attacks with Large Language Models*. I am deeply grateful to my committee members: Dr. Allen Riddell (Chair), Dr. John Walsh, Dr. Kahyun Choi, Dr. Sta≈°a Milojeviƒá, and Dr. Xiaozhong Liu. I also extend my sincere thanks to Dr. Sandra K√ºbler for her guidance. Check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-qUwhibta21vMB2wuhsTfsztl3sJVB6PLdg_6w9hwYQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [manuscript](https://hdl.handle.net/2022/33626).


- (Mar 20, 2025) I presented *Improving Scholarship Accessibility With Reinforcement Learning* at iConference, hosted at Indiana University Bloomington. Our jargon-busting AI paper has become a Best Paper finalist‚Äî[give it a read!](https://publicera.kb.se/ir/article/view/47530)

- (Feb 12, 2025) I presented a poster titled [*Thinking, Fast and Slow: DualReasoning Enhances Clinical Knowledge Extraction from Large Language Models*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11o0DyC-K7RS7Zmgpo7NR0iyxYNpowN_H/view?usp=sharing) at the Regenstrief Healthcare AI Conference. 
    - Our DualReasoning approach shows great promise in incorporating long-text medication information for diabetes phenotyping, outperforming alternative methods. 
    - It stands out as the only privacy-preserving methodüõ°, because it requires only a set of drug namesüíä rather than patient-specific drug useü§í.

- (Dec 27, 2024) Our DSH paper on solving authorship disputes of Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren's early works is out‚Äî[give it a read!](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae084)

    - In [*Science Out of Its Ivory Tower: Improving Accessibility with Reinforcement Learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17088), we simplify scholarly abstracts from a postgraduate üßë‚Äçüéì to a high school üßë‚Äçüè´ reading level without sacrificing faithfulness or quality. All of this is done by [RL-tuning a Gemma-2B](https://github.com/Wang-Haining/RLAM).
    - In [*Are Large Language Models Ready for Travel Planning?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17333), we observed that LLM generations are generally non-discriminative across gender and racial groups; however, hallucinations are more frequently associated with African American and gender minority groupsü§î.

- (Oct 15, 2024) I presented [*Language Modeling: From Teaching to Incentivizing*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/151F-KPfJtaGgt6jn-tIjrK0HgMNve_1P/view?usp=sharing) at IU Computational Linguistics Discussion Group.

Although the improvement doesn't yet make the content fully understandable for a middle-school audience, these models provide a strong baseline for further enhancement.


- (May 1, 2024) I joined [*Dr. Jing Su*](https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/51979/su-jing)'s team as an intern to work on the GAIPA project (Graph Artificial Intelligence for Precision Identification of Alcohol Use Disorder) at the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine.
