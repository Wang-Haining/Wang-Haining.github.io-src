## AI/Agent

<!-- - [*NPathQ*](https://github.com/Wang-Haining/NPathQ): Neuropathology Report QA Made Easy & Private. -->

- [*NovEval*](https://github.com/Wang-Haining/noveval): Assess scientific novelty in alignment with human evaluations.

- [*Scientific Abstract Simplification*](https://huggingface.co/haining/scientific_abstract_simplification): Rewrite complex scientific abstracts into lay summaries, making scientific knowledge accessible to everyone.


## Corpus

- [*Blog-1K*](https://zenodo.org/record/7455623#.Y5-v9uxAphG): The Blog-1K corpus is a redistributable English authorship identification benchmark. It has a roughly balanced sample distribution per author and fixed data splits (train/val/test), allowing for a fair comparison among deep learning-based models.

- [*RAABT*](https://zenodo.org/record/5213898#.YRxwLNNAphE): The Reproducible Authorship Attribution Benchmark Tasks contain five tasks for attributing the authorship of contemporary non-fiction American English prose. They have fixed training/testing splits to prevent accuracy inflation caused by homogeneous corpora.

- [*Cross-Register Authorship Attribution Corpus*](https://zenodo.org/record/5513043): This corpus contains writings from eight authors known to have written in both vernacular and classical Chinese. With 4.2 million Chinese characters, it can be useful for authorship identification research.


## Python package

- [*functionwords*](https://pypi.org/project/functionwords/): Provide curated function words in modern English and both modern/classical Chinese.

- [*writeprints-static*](https://pypi.org/project/writeprints-static/): Extract the [Writeprints-static feature set](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2382448.2382450) useful for authorship attribution studies.

## Other

- [*Unofficial IU Poster Tex Template*](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/indiana-university-iu-poster-template/pvpryrsjnczb): An unofficial poster template for Indiana University.

<!-- ### APP
