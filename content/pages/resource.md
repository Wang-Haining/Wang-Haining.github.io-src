### AI
- [Scientific Abstract Simplification](https://huggingface.co/haining/scientific_abstract_simplification): Scientific Abstract Simplification rewrites hard-to-read scientific abstracts into simpler yet relevant scientific stories. We hope our model can make scientific knowledge accessible for everyone.  


### Corpus

- [*Blog-1K*](https://zenodo.org/record/7455623#.Y5-v9uxAphG): The Blog-1K corpus is a redistributable English authorship identification benchmark. It has roughly balanced sample distribution per author and a fixed data split (train/val/test), which allows a fair comparison between deep learning-based models. 

- [*RAABT*](https://zenodo.org/record/5213898#.YRxwLNNAphE): The **R**eproducible **A**uthorship **A**ttribution **B**enchmark **T**asks contain five tasks attributing authorship of contemporary non-fiction American English prose.
It has fixed training/testing splits to prevent accuracy inflation caused by homogenous corpora.

- [*Cross-Register Authorship Attribution Corpus*](https://zenodo.org/record/5513043): This corpus contains writings of eight authors known to have written in both vernacular and classical Chinese. The corpus has 4.2 million Chinese characters and can be useful in authorship identification research.


### Python package

- [*functionwords*](https://pypi.org/project/functionwords/): a Python package provides curated function words in modern English and modern/classical Chinese.

- [*writeprints-static*](https://pypi.org/project/writeprints-static/): a Python package extracts the writeprints-static feature set (Brennan et al., 2012).


<!-- ### APP

- [*Visual DTA*](https://visual-dta.herokuapp.com/): a scientific tool visualizes the structure of topic flow within a conversation.
The `dev 0.0.5` version is online for testing. This project is under the supervision of [Prof. Susan Herring](https://info.sice.indiana.edu/~herring/). -->
