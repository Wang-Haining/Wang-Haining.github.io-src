- [*Cross-Register Authorship Attribution Corpus*](https://zenodo.org/record/5513043): This corpus contains writings of eight authors known to have written in both vernacular and classical Chinese. The corpus has 4.2 million Chinese characters and can be useful in authorship identification research.
